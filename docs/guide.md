Term Project Guideline
Project description:
A programming project that the students propose at the beginning of the semester and report at the end the semester.

Create a new work or extend an existing work regarding on a Machine Learning problem, preferred problems are "Classification" and “Clustering".

Must apply your algorithms on a real word problem. You should try at least two algorithms to solve the problem and to compare the performance of different models.

Check out the Useful links for your project, especially the "Machine Learning & Data Mining Tricks" to boost your model performance.

Project proposal requirement:

A proposal presentation.

Come up with one carefully proposed idea for a possible machine learning project, that could be done this semester.

It should include a thoughtful idea of a) background knowledge of the project and all related existing work, b) what features the data set would include and c) how and from where would the data set be gathered.

Please at least show people what topic/area (such as social network, business, bio-medical science, sports, arts, etc.) and the data you plan to work on. You are not required to know exactly the problem you need to solve from the data at this moment. But if you already have some idea, that will be great. We will discuss about details of classification, regression, clustering techniques in the following weeks, you may want to consider those problems on your project.

Give at least one fully specified example of a data set instance (data object), including a reasonable representation and value for each feature of the data object. The actual values may be fictional at this time. This effort will cause you to consider how plausible the future data gathering and representation might actually be.

Project progress report requirement:

Maximum 3 pages report prepared according to ACM conference paper templateLinks to an external site. (You can find the Word and LaTex template there, please use the two-column conference one) and submitted by the deadline in PDF format. If you need space for supplementary materials to be included, please use APPENDIX.

Show the progress you have made. It includes but not limited to - change of project topic, data preprocessing work, project initial design, how your design is differentiated from all other related existing work, flowchart/pseudo-code of the system/method, implementation of one of the ML/DM methods (not limited to the ones in class), and etc.

Show your plan towards the final paper.

Your report should be concise and focusing on what you have done so far. Your report will be graded based on the amount of work and format of the paper. Please read as many ML/AI scientific papers as possible before you start writing (look at papers published on top ML/AI conferencesLinks to an external site.), so you can have an idea of what a ML/AI scientific paper should look like.

1 minute flash show of your progress report will be in the class.

Project final report requirement:
A final presentation to show your demos, results and conclusion.

Paper must be prepared according to ACM conference paper templateLinks to an external site. (You can find the Word and LaTex template there) and submitted by the deadline in PDF format. Maximum 15 pages. If you need space for supplementary materials to be included, please use APPENDIX.

A common layout of scientific paper is: Abstract > Introduction (Background & Related Work) > Method & Approach > Experiment Details and Results > Conclusion and Discussion (Future Work) > References. Please read as many ML/AI scientific papers as possible before you start writing (look at papers published on top ML/AI conferencesLinks to an external site.), so you can have an idea of what a ML/AI scientific paper should look like. Your report will be graded based on creativity, the amount of work, and format of the paper.

Zip all your (1) original dataset, (2) source code file, (3) readme file, and any additional supplemental materials into a SINGLE .zip package and submit before the deadline. The readme file should include all tech specs and instructions of how to re-compile, re-run your code and reproduce your results. Please use screen snapshots to show the steps as demo. If your data is extremely large, please provide the link of sharable data in your readme and provide clear instruction.

Here are some example papers Download example papers and published papers from previous CSS581 students. Selected papers will be submitted to a ML/DM/AI related conference, and the student conference travel might be supported.

My personal advice on writing the project paper:
I encourage you to try your best to modify the paper according to the points below as many iterations as possible. In addition, you will need to modify your writing thoroughly and improve the quality of paper according to your own ideas after observing other published scientific papers.

1. Abstract. Very important. It is a summary of the problem, method and the results. It determines if the reviewer or reader wants to continue read your full paper.

2. Introduction. Clearly introduce the problem and background. Cite all related work to this problem. Clearly describe the data and problem. Add a simple picture if possible to help people quickly understand the problem.

3. Method. Discuss the details of the novelty of your work. Focus on your own creative idea. Why you use this idea and how you use it. A flow chart will give people an overview of your method/system. A few lines of pseudocode for the core part of method will also be good but no need to put a big chunk of source code. Use professional tools to type the formula and draw the figure.

4. Experiment and Result. Discuss all the technical details of your experiments and explain why something is good but something is not good. Try use proven waysLinks to an external site. for improving the “Accuracy” of your model. Especially you should try to use data augmentation, feature engineering, ensemble methods and etc.

If there is any related work published before. Compare the performance of yours with others (reviewers will definitely ask this if you don't have it). If there is no any previous related work, explain why and how creative your idea is.

Use easy-to-understand figure and table to show the results. Combine figures to avoid any redundancy. Use color to make it nice. Write caption and a short paragraph of description under the figure. Write caption above the table.

5. Conclusion and discussion. Similar to abstract but should focus on the current challenge and future work.

6. Reference. Please use professional citation tool to insert the citation. No Wiki page or website link should be used as citation. Use published scientific papers as reference.

7. Double check your English, grammar, and typing!
